 * Also, you don't need to worry about updating children, because they are automatically updated in the
 * {@link #update(float)} function. Just make sure that if you override the {@link #update(float)} or
 * {@link #render(float)} functions, that you call these functions in your override. Otherwise, children will not
 * be properly updated and rendered.
